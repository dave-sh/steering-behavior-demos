### Steering Behavior Demos based on work by Craig Reynolds, written in Rust

This project was intended to update old Java Applet Demonstrations of steering behavior by Craig Reynolds to have support in a more modern browser using Rust and the ggez library. 

#### Simple Behaviors 
1. Seek and Flee [Working with Bugs] <br />
   - The important values here are max_speed, max_force, and acceleration_damping.
   - Acceleration damping and interpolation should be changed so the vehicle steers more smoothly and the transition is less abrupt.
   - The position doesn't quite scale correctly, should fix this. 
3. Pursue and Evade 
4. Wander 
5. Arrival 
6. Obstacle Avoidance 
7. Containment 
8. Wall Following 
9. Path Following 
10. Flow Field Following 

#### Combined behaviors 
10. Crowd Path Following 
11. Leader Following 
12. Unaligned Collision Avoidance 
13. Queuing (at a doorway) 
14. Flocking (separation, alignment, cohesion)
